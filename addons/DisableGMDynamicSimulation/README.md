# Disable GM Dynamic Simulation

Disables dynamic simulation for Game Masters.

Game Masters receive updates on all replicated entities (e.g. characters and vehicles) by default, which can lead to replication flooded or stalled kicks if the network gets overwhelmed. This mod disables this behaviour. As a consequence, you will only be able to interact with entities near the GM camera with the exception of other player characters. If you jump the camera to a new position, it may take some time for the entities at the new location to appear. On the other hand, your connection may become more stable while in GM.
